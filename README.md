This is a basic implementation of a blockchain network using Python. It includes a Block class to represent each block, a Blockchain class to manage the chain of blocks, and some sample code to test the blockchain. You can expand on this implementation to include more advanced features such as proof-of-work, mining, and transactions. we need to develop the necessary components such as blocks, transactions, and the consensus algorithm.
